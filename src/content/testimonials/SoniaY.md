I am a client at Yangâ€™s massage therapy. I got injured from an accident. I wasnâ€™t so sure how this works with no fault and what should I do to get the treatment etc. but Canney, the massage therapist is very knowledgeable about no fault insurance, she did everything for me and I only got my prescription from the dr. When it comes to massage, she is amazing and you walk out feels like a feather ! My week starts looking forward to go to herðŸ˜Š you will love to go to her, and I highly recommend her
