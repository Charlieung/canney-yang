I am grateful and appreciate that Ms. Yang provide the cold+hot+cold method of marble stone therapy to help decreasing my muscle pain and strain since my neck surgery couple weeks ago, itâ€™s amazing that cold stone really help to decrease the inflammation and increase circulation. I love this special Luxury treatment. I appreciate my spine specialist referred me to have medical massage.
