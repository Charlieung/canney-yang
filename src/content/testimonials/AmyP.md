Canney is the best around. She is very knowledgeable, knows how to make her clients feel good, and has excellent technique. I came to her after a car accident, and she worked on helping me get better. Not only does she do massage therapy, but she also uses hot stones, cold stone therapy, cupping, and traditional Chinese technique guasha. She also included stretching in our sessions, which really helped me out. She uses hot towels to clean you off so your clothes dont get dirty! She also uses essential smelling oils. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a medical massage or even a regular massage.
