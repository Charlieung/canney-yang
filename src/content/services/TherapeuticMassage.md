Therapeutic Massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body. Therapeutic Massage is a highly effective method for releasing chronic stress areas due to misalignment, repetitive motions, and past lingering injuries. Due to the nature of the Therapeutic work, open communication during the session is crucial to make sure you don't get too uncomfortable. Keep in mind that soreness is pretty common after the treatment, and that plenty of water should be ingested to aid with the flushing and removal of toxins that will have been released from the Therapeutic during the session.
