                <p class="large text-muted">I'm a very serious and responsible person. Massage therapy helps people to relieve stress. I have received massage treatment more than 20 years. I know how the effect of massage is to make the whole body and mind healthier. When you are healthy, then you feel happy and have a greater sense of well-being. There is a Chinese saying, "When the wealth is lost nothing is lost. When the health is lost something is lost...". It means that health should be considered more important than any other wealth.</p>
