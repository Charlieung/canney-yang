                <p class="large text-muted">I specialize and accept no-fault/PIP case medical massage therapy since 2012. According to the statistics, we found that 95% of injured patients do not know that they have medical massage therapy covered after car accidents. I'd like to share this benefit to anyone who experienced suffering pain after a MVA. Many of our patients have found medical massage therapy to be an effective treatment for pain and discomfort related to whiplash and lumbar trauma. No-Fault/PIP automobile insurance will mostly cover massage therapy for their injuries. We'll guide you on how to follow up with the treatments.</p>
                <p class="large text-muted">Some injured people stopped the treatment when they found out the insurance sent them denied letters. Please donâ€™t panic, as I will assist and show you how to proceed with the right treatments.</p>
                <p class="large text-muted">CY (See Why) Massage Therapy includes therapeutic different modalities such as manual lymphatic massage therapy, myofascial release, neuromuscular re-education, hot or cold packs/stone and stretching. Free referrals to different specialties. Also in my clinic, there is an acupuncturist who will accept no-fault acupuncture treatment.</p>
